- example of text-based graph serialization format
    desc: goal is to emulate what people do naturally when writing e.g. todo.txt in a repo or during a meeting.
    a dash denotes a task, indentation denotes a subtask, and dependencies are specified by giving tasks ids and then putting 
    "id1 -> id2" somewhere (does not have to be at the "right" indentation level).
    additional attributes are specified by starting a line with one of a number of keywords followed by a colon
    (for example, "desc:" or "description:" starts the longer description for the node)
    - flahdsf
    - c: althalnbaf
    - adhfadsf
        - a: aldfh adhfadsf
        - lakdhfadf
            1. lskjdfa
            2. lkdjfad
            3. asdoihv
        - b: asldjasd
        a -> b
c -> b
